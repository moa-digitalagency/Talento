The project aims to provide a robust, scalable solution for talent management and discovery, enhancing professional networking and recruitment across the continent.

## Recent Changes (October 20, 2025)

- **CINEMA Module - Public Registration (v2.21.0)**: Made CINEMA talent registration publicly accessible. Changes include: (1) Removed `@login_required` decorator from `/cinema/register` route for public access, (2) Added "CINEMA üé¨" button in public navigation menu (desktop and mobile) accessible to non-logged users, (3) Modified `base_cinema.html` to conditionally display sidebar only for authenticated users while public users see full-width registration form, (4) Changed submit button from gradient style to corporate `btn-primary` style matching main registration form. Registration form now follows exact same design patterns as `/auth/register` with section-colored boxes, dotted borders, and no gradients anywhere.
- **CINEMA Module (v2.20.0)**: Complete CINEMA universe with full talent registration system. Enhanced features include: (1) Dedicated database model `CinemaTalent` with encrypted sensitive data (ID document number, phone, WhatsApp, social media), (2) Multi-step registration form with 7 sections (Identity, ID Document, Location, Languages & Experience, Physical Characteristics, Photos & Contact, Social Media & Productions) following the same design patterns as main registration, (3) Sidebar navigation with 5 sections: Dashboard, Talents, Productions, Projects, and Technical Team, (4) Full CRUD routes for talent management with `/cinema/register` endpoint, (5) Talent listing page with search filters and table view, (6) File upload support for profile photos, ID photos, and photo galleries stored in `cinema_photos` directory, (7) Data isolation - all CINEMA data is stored separately from main Talento database in `cinema_talents` table. The module is fully functional and ready for talent registration with all fields from the requirements (full name, document type, ethnicity, nationality, languages, physical characteristics, previous productions, etc.).
- **Complete Backup & Restore System (v2.18.0)**: Implemented comprehensive backup/restore functionality for full application migration. Admin settings page now includes: (1) "Cr√©er une sauvegarde compl√®te" button that generates a ZIP archive containing all user profiles with **decrypted sensitive data** (phone, address, passport, residence card, social media), uploaded files (photos, CVs, QR codes), database content, and configuration; (2) "Restauration compl√®te" form with file upload that restores all data and automatically **re-encrypts sensitive fields** during import. Security enhancements include: Zip Slip protection with path validation before extraction, transactional restore with automatic rollback on errors, primary key sequence reset for PostgreSQL/SQLite compatibility, robust ISO datetime parsing with error handling, cleanup of temporary files using `after_this_request`, and CSRF protection via Flask-WTF. System warns users about destructive nature of restore operations with confirmation dialogs.
- **Bulk User Management & Enhanced Admin Controls (v2.17.0)**: Added comprehensive bulk deletion features for admin efficiency. Dashboard (`index.html`) and Talents listing (`talents.html`) now include: (1) individual "Supprimer" buttons in the Actions column for quick single-user deletion with confirmation, (2) checkboxes on each user row enabling multi-select, (3) "Supprimer s√©lectionn√©s" button for batch deletion with double confirmation and counter display. All deletion routes include secure redirect validation using `is_safe_url()` function to prevent open redirect vulnerabilities while maintaining navigation flow (admins return to their originating page after deletion). Enhanced Settings page with new "Backup & Restore" section providing clear access to data export tools (Excel, CSV, PDF) and honest messaging about future import functionality. Database section styling fixed with proper dotted borders for visual consistency.
- **Database-Driven Settings (v2.16.0)**: Complete redesign of settings management. API keys (SendGrid, OpenRouter) and configuration are now stored in the database (`app_settings` table) instead of environment variables. Admin settings page includes: (1) API key input fields with secure masking, (2) configurable sender email (default: noreply@myoneart.com), (3) live email testing functionality, and (4) integrated admin user creation. The system reads from database with automatic fallback to environment variables for backward compatibility.
- **Admin Settings Page (v2.15.0)**: New `/admin/settings` page for administrators with API key status monitoring (SendGrid, OpenRouter), admin user management (promote/demote users), and system configuration overview.
- **Enhanced CV Analysis Display (v2.15.0)**: Profile view now intelligently displays three states: (1) "Aucun CV disponible" with upload button when no CV exists, (2) "CV en cours de traitement" when CV uploaded but not analyzed, (3) Full analysis with score when available.
- **Navigation Menu Update (v2.15.0)**: Added "Param√®tres" (Settings) link in navigation menu for admin users (desktop and mobile), providing quick access to system configuration.
- **Admin Management Features (v2.15.0)**: Admins can now promote regular users to admin status and demote other admins (with safeguards: cannot self-demote, cannot remove last admin).
- **SendGrid Email Integration (v2.14.0)**: Integrated SendGrid for automated email notifications. New candidates receive two emails: (1) application confirmation with profile link and optional PDF attachment, and (2) login credentials with unique code and randomly generated password.
- **OpenRouter AI Integration (v2.14.0)**: Added intelligent CV analysis using OpenRouter API. System automatically analyzes uploaded CVs, extracts skills, generates professional summaries, and assigns profile scores (0-100).
- **Dual Authentication (v2.14.0)**: Users can now login with either email OR unique code, making access easier for candidates who prefer using their unique identifier.
- **Candidate Self-Service (v2.14.0)**: Candidates can now edit their own profiles, update information, upload new CVs (which triggers automatic re-analysis), and manage their talents.
- **Profile Scoring & Analysis Display (v2.14.0)**: Profile view now shows AI-generated analysis with circular score indicator, detected skills, strengths, recommendations, and experience years.
- **QR Code Fix (v2.13.0)**: Fixed QR code generation to use proper HTTPS URLs that open profile pages in browsers instead of displaying text. QR codes are automatically regenerated on app restart.
- **Navigation Improvements (v2.13.0)**: Fixed back button on profile pages to return to `/talents` list. Added responsive hamburger menu for mobile/tablet navigation while keeping Talento logo always visible.
- **Responsive Design (v2.13.0)**: QR codes are now hidden on mobile and tablet devices (visible only on desktop) to optimize space and improve mobile experience.
